Revision history for Perl extension String::MkPasswd.

0.02  Wed Mar 17 08:17:10 PST 2004
	- Applied changes from Adrian Gee <adrian.gee@anu.edu.au> allowing -minnum,
	  -minlower, -minupper and -minspecial to be zero in the call to
	  mkpasswd().
	- Fixed mkpasswd.pl so it actually works.  It was passing the wrong key
	  names to mkpasswd(), so the defaults were always used.
	- Added --no{num,lower,upper,special} options to mkpasswd.pl as
	  alternatives to --min{num,lower,upper,special}=0.

0.01  Wed Nov 12 17:29:08 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		--compat-version=5.6.1 --omit-autoload --omit-XS --name=String::MkPasswd --use-new-tests
